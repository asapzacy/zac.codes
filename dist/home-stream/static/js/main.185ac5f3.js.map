Wraps a single child without adding\n\tadditional DOM nodes.\n\t\n\tThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\n\tanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\n\tto the child on the next tick.\n\t\n\tBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\n\tcommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\n\tback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\n\tthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\n\treturn to after animating away.\n\t\n\tProperties:\n\t animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n\t   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n\t runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n\t targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n\t   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only\n\t   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.\n\t   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.\n\t   A special value of \"children\" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a\n\t   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.\n\t\n\tUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. \"duration\", \"delay\", \"loop\").\n\t\n\tMethods:\n\t runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that\n\t   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a \"bump\" when a click\n\t   occurs).\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar _ = {\n\t  forEach: __webpack_require__(44),\n\t  isEqual: __webpack_require__(89),\n\t  keys: __webpack_require__(17),\n\t  omit: __webpack_require__(90),\n\t};\n\tvar React = __webpack_require__(5);\n\tvar ReactDOM = __webpack_require__(49);\n\tvar Velocity = __webpack_require__(69);\n\t\n\tvar VelocityComponent = React.createClass({\n\t  displayName: 'VelocityComponent',\n\t\n\t  propTypes: {\n\t    animation: React.PropTypes.any,\n\t    children: React.PropTypes.element.isRequired,\n\t    runOnMount: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\t    targetQuerySelector: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t    // Any additional properties will be sent as options to Velocity\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  getDefaultProps: function () {\n\t    return {\n\t      animation: null,\n\t      runOnMount: false,\n\t      targetQuerySelector: null,\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentDidMount: function () {\n\t    this.runAnimation();\n\t\n\t    // Jump to the end so that the component has the visual appearance of the animation having\n\t    // been run to completion.\n\t    if (this.props.runOnMount !== true) {\n\t      this._finishAnimation();\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentWillUpdate: function (newProps, newState) {\n\t    if (!_.isEqual(newProps.animation, this.props.animation)) {\n\t      this._stopAnimation();\n\t      this._scheduleAnimation();\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  componentWillUnmount: function () {\n\t    this._stopAnimation();\n\t    this._clearVelocityCache(this._getDOMTarget());\n\t  },\n\t\n\t  // It's ok to call this externally!

Wraps a single child without adding\nadditional DOM nodes.\n\nThe API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what\nanimation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation\nto the child on the next tick.\n\nBy default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's \"finish\"\ncommand is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and\nback in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the \"animate into\" animation as\nthe default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to\nreturn to after animating away.\n\nProperties:\n animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation\n   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)\n runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.\n targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector\n   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to.

Delegates to the React TransitionGroup\naddon.\n\nProperties\n  enter: Animation to run on a child component being added\n  leave: Animation to run on a child component leaving\n  runOnMount: if true, runs the \"enter\" animation on the elements that exist as children when this\n    component is mounted.\n  enterHideStyle/enterShowStyle: see below.\n\nAny additional properties (e.g. \"className\", \"component\") will be passed to the internal\nTransitionGroup.\n\n\"enter\" and \"leave\" should either be a string naming an animation, or a hash with an\n\"animation\" key that can either be a string itself, or a hash of style attributes to animate (this\nvalue is passed to Velocity its the first arg).\n\nIf \"enter\" or \"leave\" is a hash, it can additionally have a \"style\" value that is applied the tick\nbefore the Velocity animation starts. Use this for non-animating properties (like \"position\") that\nare prerequisites for correct animation. The style value is applied using Velocity's JS -> CSS\nroutines, which may differ from React's.\n\nAny hash entries beyond \"animation\" and \"style\" are passed in an options hash to Velocity. Use this\nfor options like \"stagger\", \"reverse\", &tc.\n\nBy default, this component will immediately hide all entering children with display: 'none', and\nunhide them one tick later with display: ''. This is done so that we can coalesce multiple enters\ninto a single animation, and we want to avoid any popping of elements in while they're collected. If\nyou prefer a different way of hiding these elements so that e.g. geometry can be immediately\ncalculated, use the enterHideStyle and enterShowStyle props to provide alternate style hashes for\nhiding and revealing entering elements.\n\nStatics\n  disabledForTest: Set this to true globally to turn off all custom animation logic. Instead, this\n    component will behave like a vanilla TransitionGroup.\n\nInspired by https://gist.github.com/tkafka/0d94c6ec94297bb67091\n*/\n\nvar _ = {\n  each: require('lodash/collection/each'),\n  extend: require('lodash/object/extend'),\n  forEach: require('lodash/collection/forEach'),\n  isEqual: require('lodash/lang/isEqual'),\n  keys: require('lodash/object/keys'),\n  omit: require('lodash/object/omit'),\n  pluck: require('lodash/collection/pluck'),\n};\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar ReactTransitionGroup = require('react-addons-transition-group');\nvar Velocity = require('./lib/velocity-animate-shim');\n\n// Shim requestAnimationFrame for browsers that don't support it, in particular IE 9.\nvar shimRequestAnimationFrame =\n  (typeof window !== 'undefined') && (\n    window.requestAnimationFrame ||\n    window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||\n    window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||\n    function(callback) { window.setTimeout(callback, 0) }\n  );\n\n// Fix 'Invalid calling object' error in IE\nshimRequestAnimationFrame = (typeof window !== 'undefined') &&  shimRequestAnimationFrame.bind(window);\n\n// Internal wrapper for the transitioned elements.
