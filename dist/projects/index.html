                <section class="details__section">
                  <h4 class="details__header">execution</h4>
                  <p class="details__content">There were a few distinct areas that went into building the web app.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">React core -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">To start it off, I wanted to learn <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" class="details__link">react.js</a>. I chose react, because (outside of it being insanely popular and taking over the frontend industry this past year) it was exactly what I needed, a view layer, and nothing more. So I started off learning react with <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router" class="details__link">react-router</a>, which I found to be impressively powerful and perfect for the job.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Thanks to the <a href="https://reactjsprogram.com" class="details__link">reactjsprogram.com</a>, I felt like I learned good practices going into this and before building my first react app. I implemented modularity through the use of functional (stateful) containers and presentational (stateless) components. Also, I used <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules" class="details__link">css modules</a> to keep all class names and styling locally scoped.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">Build tools -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content"><a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack" class="details__link">Webpack</a> was the backbone to the whole project (and thank you to all the webpack open-source contributors), between hot-module replacement and compiling, you couldn’t ask for a better front end development environment. I used es6 extensively throughout the project with the help of <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel" class="details__link">babel</a>.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">Packages -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">All the json data came from public and accessible URLs on the web. I used the <a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios" class="details__link">axios</a> package for a promise-based HTTP client in grabbing the data. After receiving the promise (on success), I would clean the data, update the isLoading state, and pass the data to stateless presentational components to display the data.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Another package that was perfect for the job was <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment" class="details__link">moment</a>. I was dealing with a lot of dates and times from the various leagues and schedules; moment made the day-to-day navigation clear and simple.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">Backend -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">Getting the web app on the Internet was another area of learning. I set up a $5 <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" class="details__link">DigitalOcean</a> droplet running Ubuntu. I added https/ssl to the base site, and used <a href="http://nginx.org/" class="details__link">nginx</a> + <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="details__link">node</a> + <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express" class="details__link">express</a> to serve a <code>/dist</code> directory of static resources.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">The build process is a little awkward (and I’d love to set up continuous integration eventually). Right now I am writing code locally and pushing it to github, but before every <code>git push</code>, I need to build out the <code>bundle.js</code> file + whatever else is needed. When I want to update the web app, I <code>ssh</code> into the server and <code>git pull</code> from there.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="details__section">
                  <h4 class="details__header">what I learned</h4>
                  <p class="details__content">I learned a lot. Besides all the tooling and languages and whatnot, I learned that I could build exactly what I had envisioned in my head. From hardly knowing javascript, to never touching react before, or setting up a server, ssl certifications, and such, I achieved everything that I envisioned.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">On top of this, I learned the importance of modularizing your code into small and reusable components. Setting up the original MLB-only page was fast and easy, adding additional leagues and games was the difficult part. I probably refactored every line of code since the original, but I did learn the importance of reusing code and not repeating yourself for future changes or edits.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Also, I realized the importance of thinking ahead and planning for where the app is headed. I knew all along I would like to implement multiple leagues, so I should’ve started with the mindsight of using state and props that would work for any input of data (i.e. instead of using <em>innings</em> as a prop, use <em>periods</em> or <em>segments</em> from the beginning to work with everything from tennis to college basketball).</p>
                </section>
                <section class="details__section">
                  <h4 class="details__header">what I would've done differently</h4>
                  <p class="details__content">Although I felt happy with the end results, I would’ve done a lot differently.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">First off, I would’ve created a simple database from the beginning that stored all the leagues and game data. Right now, the app is fetching a json file (if the url parameters are valid) on every page load. Instead of fetching a file from last season, it would’ve been nice to set up a database from the beginning that stored every piece of data as it was initially fetched/loaded. Typically, only [yesterday], [today], and [tomorrow]’s data could change when it comes to sporting events (i.e. game delay - change of game time/date – official review score change – updated final stats - etc.), so fetching every game is unnecessary and a waste of resources and also hurting the page speed.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Also, the CORS issue was one of my largest problems. Working locally, everything works as expected. But when I set the server up and get everything live, my https site and can only receive requests from other https origins. So two of the four data sources stopped working. NBA and MLB both come from http origins, so getting those to work was difficult and I’d still like to improve on this. I was using <a href="https://crossorigin.me" class="details__link">crossorigin.me</a> as a quick hack/fix to the problem, but sometimes that website will go down, breaking my website – (still need to fix this).</p>
                </section>
                <p class="details__tldr"><strong><code>tl;dr</code></strong> All in all, I learned a lot about frontend development and programming in general, plus I had a blast making it. A fully-functional, live sports scoreboard built on react.js and es6. I have a lot of features I'd love to add, and will continue working on it.</p>

                  <p class="details__content">I needed a portfolio website (or <em>at least they say you do</em>) before I started applying for jobs. So, I set out to create something light and clean-looking, while learning vanilla javascript from the ground up.</p>

                <section class="details__section">
                  <h4 class="details__header">thought process</h4>
                  <p class="details__content">The original idea was to create a single-page app without the use of any javascript framework or library. I also had this vision of the main content scrolling under/beneath a fixed, mountain-looking footer throughout the app.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">I also wanted it to...</p>

                    <li class="details__listItem">be quick as always (everything is compressed, minified, and I favored svgs over images).</li>
                    <li class="details__listItem">for the URLs to be functional  – I didn’t want to use the <em>hashbang approach</em> (it looks unprofessional in my opinion); instead I wanted all the URLs to be digestable in an easy format: <code>domain.com/${page-name}</code>.

                    <li class="details__listItem">minimal –  users don’t like to think, so I kept things as simple as I could.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="details__content">In the future, I would love to add a custom blog.

                <section class="details__section">
                  <h4 class="details__header">execution</h4>
                  <p class="details__content">Beyond the typical build tools etc., there were a few unique aspects for this project </p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">SPA -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">The most important feature I wanted to achieve was making it a true single-page application; never needing a reload.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">This is much easier to do when using the <em>hashbang approach</em>, putting an event listener on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/hashchange" class="details__link">hashchange event</a>, and updating the content through ajax. But, like I said above, I didn’t want to use the <em>hashbang approach</em>, and I also wanted the URLs to be approachable to both users and web crawlers.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Although simple, I made three static html pages. Whenever the url changes, I check the path, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" class="details__link">fetch</a> the http request, and update the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> elements accordingly; fading out the old and in the new. Users with javascript turned off are still able to access the page through a traditional reload.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">60fps -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">Before this project, I was able to use css transitions/animations and make them look alright, but I never really understood concepts like frames-per-second, repaints, and how the browser handles DOM updates.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Almost everything on my app could’ve (and most likely, should’ve) been done in css, but I wanted to learn javascript. With the help of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame" class="details__link"><code>requestAnimationFrame</code></a> and <a href=" https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294" class="details__link">a few timing sequences</a>, I created a few basic functions, all achieving 60fps: <code>fadeIn</code>, <code>fadeOut</code>, <code>scrollToTop</code>, <code>expandDetails</code>, <code>fullScreenView</code>, and so on.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">When I didn’t use javascript, I made sure that my css was only touching <code>opacity</code> or <code>transform</code> properties, the only two css properties that can be animated entirely on GPU acceleration.</p>
                  <h5 class="details__subheader">DOM -</h5 class="details__subheader">
                  <p class="details__content">While I knew the basic ideas of the DOM before this project, it was really enough just to get by and create functional React apps and static webpages.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Even though DOM manipulation isn’t it’s own language, separate from javascript, it is clearly distinct. Someone can fully grasp and use javascript as a programming language (node), without knowing how to change and update content on a webpage. From event listeners, to event bubbling, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/history" class="details__link">html5 History API</a>, screen widths and heights, and the good old console, I learned a lot about the Document Object Model.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">I had plenty of knowledge of html and css from previous years experience, and felt like I could build whatever static website I had envisioned. Learning javascript and DOM manipulation felt like cheating it was so easy, and I regret not taking it up sooner.  Now I feel like I can create whatever design or implementation I can think of, or <a href="https://stripe.com/" class="details__link">reverse-engineer cool stuff I see from professional companies employing professional frontend engineers [check the header].</a></p>

                  <p class="details__content">There was one large issue that kept coming up for me: <strong>duplication</strong>.</p>
                  <p class="details__content">Since each page had it's own actual, static html content, I was forced to manually copy and paste over edits to each .html file whenever I updated something in the general template. For example, if I wanted to change the fonts coming from google fonts api, I would edit the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag on one page, and then need to copy-paste the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element to the other two pages. Having a general template, consisting of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements would’ve been extremely nice. I wasted way too much time doing this, and regret being naive in not learning a templating engine such as <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/" class="details__link">handlerbars</a> or <a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/" class="details__link">mustache</a> from early on.</p>
